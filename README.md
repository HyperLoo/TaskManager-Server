This is the Server Section for is the [Task Management App](https://myhacktaskmanager.netlify.app)

An App to manage Day to Day Tasks by maintaining Records in the App.

## Active Section

Here you can add your `Active Tasks` to the app with all the `details` including `Due Date`(deadline) and other details like `Label` and `Status` of the Task. On these Tasks, one can perform `CRUD` operations and update `labels`.

A Task is added to archive if it is `Updated` with a Status `Completed` or if it crosses its `deadline` / `dueDate`.

The `Safer` (that have not approached deadline) are with a `green` outline and that have `approached Deadline` are in `red` outline.

## Archived Section

In `Archived Section`, one can see details of all the `Archived Tasks`, and can `delete` them but `cannot modify`.

## Stats Section

Here one can see `Stats` of Tasks `Graphically`.
